  <h1>Hail, adventurer!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to 2P Mode 4 Life, a website that tracks the progress my friends and I make as we learn to play Pathfinder and go through the Rise of the Runelords campaign.</p>
  <p>Here you will find descriptions of the party members, session notes, and my personal notes on learning to be a DM.</p>
