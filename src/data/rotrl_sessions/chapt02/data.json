				"Three weeks pass. Icentress teaches Shadowmist a few commands and acquires a mountain lion as an animal companion. Drakard performed in the Rusty Dragon, and gave his earning to Ameiko to cover his ale consumption.",
				"The party learns from Sherriff Hemlock that a murder occurred in the Sandpoint sawmill the night before, and asks them to investigate. He also gives them a threatening note found at the scene and addressed to Icentress, signed \"Your Lordship.\" They find footprints leading to and from the nearby river, an axe strong with the rotten smell of death, and Harker's body covered in claw wounds.",
				"From interviewing Ibor Thorn, the sawmill worker who found the murder scene that morning, the party finds out that Harker was embezzling money from the sawmill's operations. When they interview Ven Vinder, the father of the female victim, he is belligerent and screaming at the PCs. After being intimidated by Qola, he breaks down into tears instead.",
				"The party visits Habe's sanatorium, where the only surviving person from a set of murders two days prior was being held. Sarra was able to diagnose the victim Tabe as suffering from ghoul fever. Tabe delivered a message to Icentress from Your Lordship, then broke free of his straitjacket and attacked but was put down by a scorching ray from Khellis.",
				"The party also met Brodert Quink, a local scholar of Varisian history. Sarra and Brodert go over the seven pointed star the party has been encountering and that has been carved into the chests of the recent murder victims. They identify it as the Sihedron Rune and discuss the symbol's various meanings."

				"The party travels to Magnimar. Drakard disguises himself as Aldern Foxglove and the party enters the Foxglove's townhouse in the city, only to find themselves face-to-face with Aldern and Ieasha Foxglove.",
				"The Foxgloves at home in the townhouse are really shapeshifters, who attack and are defeated by the party. Our heroes bury the bodies in the backyard of the townhouse.",
				"The afternoon is spent observing the Seven's Sawmill in the south-east of the city while Drakard talks up Gloin, a dwarven bartender at a high-end wine bar called Spirits.",
				"At midnight, a man is brought into the sawmill. The party follows, only to discover a group of scarlet-clad cultists performing a ritual. As the Sihedron rune is being carved into the man's chest, the party strikes. Khellis attempts to catch the entire group in a mass of tentacles, but fails and instead draws the attention of all present. The party holds the stairwell and slowly cut down the cult members.",
				"The man they save explains that he was gambling on dice in a back-alley of the Underbridge when he was attacked. The other gamblers were killed, but he was knocked out and brought to the sawmill.",
				"At the top of the sawmill was a group of trained messanger ravens. With the <i>light</i> spell cast on the bird, Icentress watches it fly to the rotting bell tower in the Underbridge.",
				"The next day, our heroes arrive at the base of the Shadow Clock. As they begin climbing, a massive golem dressed as a scarecrow attacks. Both Khellis and Sarra attack with their spells, but they have no effect. Qola and Icentress bring the golem crashing down through sheer force.",
				"As they climb higher, one of the bells comes crashing down through the tower. Khellis flys to the top and sees three more shapeshifters were responsible for cutting the support ropes. The enemies are knocked off their perches by Nala and Khellis.",
				"At the top of the tower, the party discovers a nest of fine cloths and silks. Khellis casts <i>see invisibility</i> and sees a large half woman, half snake creature in the corner armed with a large spear. Khellis and Drakard use flour and glitterdust to expose the creature, and the party attacks. Khellis' spells pin the creature to one side of the room, until she turns him to stone with her mask. Qola keeps her attention, while Sarra tends to Qola, Icentress uses her arrows, and Drakard hides behind a statue to perform and inspire the party.",
				"The creature is defeated, and in her nest they find a letter from her sister in Turtleback Ferry, claiming that her operation there was better than the one in Magnimar. The note concludes with an ominous questions - has the lord-mayor been sacrificed yet?"
