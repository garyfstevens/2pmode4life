				"Three weeks pass. Icentress teaches Shadowmist a few commands and acquires a mountain lion as an animal companion. Drakard performed in the Rusty Dragon, and gave his earning to Ameiko to cover his ale consumption.",
				"The party learns from Sherriff Hemlock that a murder occurred in the Sandpoint sawmill the night before, and asks them to investigate. He also gives them a threatening note found at the scene and addressed to Icentress, signed \"Your Lordship.\" They find footprints leading to and from the nearby river, an axe strong with the rotten smell of death, and Harker's body covered in claw wounds.",
				"From interviewing Ibor Thorn, the sawmill worker who found the murder scene that morning, the party finds out that Harker was embezzling money from the sawmill's operations. When they interview Ven Vinder, the father of the female victim, he is belligerent and screaming at the PCs. After being intimidated by Qola, he breaks down into tears instead.",
				"The party visits Habe's sanatorium, where the only surviving person from a set of murders two days prior was being held. Sarra was able to diagnose the victim Tabe as suffering from ghoul fever. Tabe delivered a message to Icentress from Your Lordship, then broke free of his straitjacket and attacked but was put down by a scorching ray from Khellis.",
				"The party also met Brodert Quink, a local scholar of Varisian history. Sarra and Brodert go over the seven pointed star the party has been encountering and that has been carved into the chests of the recent murder victims. They identify it as the Sihedron Rune and discuss the symbol's various meanings."
